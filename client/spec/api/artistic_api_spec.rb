  # Transform an image into an artistic painting automatically
  # Uses machine learning to automatically transform an image into an artistic painting.  Due to depth of AI processing, depending on image size this operation can take up to 20 seconds.
  # @param style The style of the painting to apply.  To start, try \&quot;udnie\&quot; a painting style.  Possible values are: \&quot;udnie\&quot;, \&quot;wave\&quot;, \&quot;la_muse\&quot;, \&quot;rain_princess\&quot;.
  # @param image_file Image file to perform the operation on.  Common file formats such as PNG, JPEG are supported.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @return [String]
